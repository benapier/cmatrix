A simple matrix library in C++ which takes advantage of operator overloading so that matrices can be treated like any other common data types (double, integer, etc.).

Current features:
* Basic matrix arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
* Basic scalar arithmetic (multiplication, division)
* Transposition
* Determinants
* Inverse

Planned features:
* Concatination
* Kronecker multiplication
* Hadanard multiplication
